## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: Tue, Nov 29, 2022

**Topic:** It's never DNS

**Abstract:**<br/>
Christian and Simon will talk about ll the things you never knew you needed to know about DNS, the Domain Name System. or at least as much as can be fit into a single talk.
DNS is often referred to as the "phonebook of the Internet". It's so ubiquitous that almost anything we do on the Internet starts with a DNS query. Few areas of Internet have as many RFC's that touch upon it as DNS.

We'll start by looking at the question "what is DNS?" and go from there. We will touch upon various areas of DNS; wildcard records, and why they somtimes don't work ...or at least not the way you'd expect. DNS privacy or the lack there of. Why you should use DNSSEC alongside encrypted DNS. Towards the end we'll talk a bit about what's cooking in the world of DNS 


**Bio:**<br/>
Christian is working as DNS Systems engineer at Cloudflare, the worlds fastest DNS service provider (according to https://www.dnsperf.com/) serving many millions of zones. He's been working with DNS for close to two decades, and known to be messing around with DNSSEC. A pragmatist who's known for shooting down solutions that are too complex. Frequently doing woodworking, blacksmithing or the occasional archery session when given time after tending to beehives.
