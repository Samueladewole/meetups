## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Skåne

**Date**: Tuesday, March 5, 2024

**Topic:** Developer experience in regulated industries - it doesn't actually suck!

**Abstract:**<br/>

Regulated industries: healthcare, banking, insurance, transport, energy... the list goes on. 
Especially with the new NIS2 regulation, almost all developers will work in a “regulated industry”. 
Certainly a lot of SaaS is covered. 
Most developers think that as information security requirements go up, Developer Experience (DX) plummets. 
By the end of this talk, we hope that you are as convinced as we are that the opposite is true!

This talk will be about:

- Why the EU increasingly forces your boss to see information security as a feature and not "overhead".
- What EU regulations you need to tell your boss about.
- What you need to know to help your boss comply with EU regulations.
- How Policy as Code can give the immediate feedback us developers are used to.
- How deployment via GitOps is not just safer, but also ties very naturally into our code review process.
- How container platforms can offer security in layers outside of the application itself, embedding it in security without code changes.
